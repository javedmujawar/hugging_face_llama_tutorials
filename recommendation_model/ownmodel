i have all user history and want ai model for user where user i need to some recommndation few url to user based on user data

Since you have all user browsing history, we can build a personalized AI recommendation model using Ollama and machine learning techniques. Below is a structured approach:

üìå Steps to Build an AI Model for URL Recommendations
‚úÖ Data Preparation: Organize and preprocess user history.
‚úÖ Feature Extraction: Convert URLs into embeddings using NLP.
‚úÖ Model Training: Train a recommendation model using Ollama + Machine Learning.
‚úÖ Prediction & Serving: Recommend URLs based on past behavior.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation
Your data should have columns like:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
user_id | timestamp  | url                            | title                        | category     | visit_count
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
101     | 2025-03-26 | https://github.com/ollama-ai  | "Ollama GitHub Repo"        | "Coding"     | 10
101     | 2025-03-26 | https://stackoverflow.com     | "Fine-tune Llama Model"     | "Coding"     | 7
102     | 2025-03-26 | https://amazon.com/deals     | "Amazon Best Deals"         | "Shopping"   | 3
2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Extraction (Embedding URLs & Titles)
We will convert URLs and titles into numerical vectors using TF-IDF or OpenAI embeddings.

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
import pandas as pd

# Load user history data
data = pd.read_csv("user_history.csv")  # Replace with actual file

# Convert URLs & Titles into vectors
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words="english")
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(data["title"] + " " + data["category"])

# Save vectorized data for training
import numpy as np
np.save("tfidf_embeddings.npy", tfidf_matrix.toarray())
3Ô∏è‚É£ AI Model Training Using Ollama (LLM)
We will fine-tune Ollama to generate recommendations using user history.

Fine-tuning Ollama
Install Ollama

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install ollama
Prepare Training Data (Pairs of User & Recommended URLs)

plaintext
Copy
Edit
User: "I visited GitHub, suggest me similar coding sites"
AI: "Check out Stack Overflow, MDN Web Docs, and GitLab"
Train Ollama with Your Own Data

bash
Copy
Edit
ollama create my-recommendation-model --from llama2
Fine-Tune with User Data

python
Copy
Edit
import ollama

model = ollama.Model("my-recommendation-model")
response = model.generate("I visited GitHub, suggest some coding websites")
print(response)  # AI-generated recommendations
4Ô∏è‚É£ Generate User-Specific Recommendations
We will use Collaborative Filtering + AI-generated insights.

python
Copy
Edit
from scipy.sparse.linalg import svds
import numpy as np

# Load vector embeddings
tfidf_embeddings = np.load("tfidf_embeddings.npy")

# Perform Matrix Factorization (Collaborative Filtering)
U, sigma, Vt = svds(tfidf_embeddings, k=5)
sigma = np.diag(sigma)

# Generate recommendations
predictions = np.dot(np.dot(U, sigma), Vt)
recommended_indices = np.argsort(-predictions[0])[:5]  # Top 5 recommendations

# Map to URLs
recommended_urls = data.iloc[recommended_indices]["url"].tolist()
print("Recommended URLs:", recommended_urls)
üî• Next Steps
Enhance AI: Use user feedback (clicked/not clicked) to improve recommendations.

Deploy as API: Use FastAPI or Flask to serve recommendations.

Integrate with Chrome Extension: Push recommendations via browser notifications.
